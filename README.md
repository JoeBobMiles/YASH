> Yet Another SVG Helper

## What is YASH?

YASH is a project to create, well, yet _another_ SVG helper. As the name implies,
there are many like it, but this one is mine.

YASH is the result of me waking up at 2am and learning (finally) how SVGs
worked. I quickly got tired of handwriting XML into CodePen, and was too lazy to
look up how to import npm packages (I'm pretty sure you can't), so I started
implementing my own helper for programmatically drawing SVG shapes. The code
quickly ballooned in size as I developed the API until I decided to pull it out
of the Pen it had become cramped in and create my own (and very first!) NPM
package out of it.
